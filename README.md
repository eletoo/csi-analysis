# Script Documentation
The `main.py` file contains the code that, by
calling functions contained in other Python files 
whose content is described in section
[Python files content](README.md#python-files-content), 
plots the content of the following folders:
* [auto-correlation_graphs](auto-correlation_graphs): 
auto-correlation graphs plotted using python's 
`statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots.plot_acf` function in 
[autocorrelation_plotter.py](autocorrelation_plotter.py)

* [auto-correlation_through_formulae](auto-correlation_through_formulae): 
auto-correlation graphs plotted using manually-typed formulae in 
[autocorrelation_plotter.py](autocorrelation_plotter.py)

* [best_fits_params](best_fits_params) and sub-folders: each sub-folder
is named after one of the five distributions that best fit the increments
of the sub-carriers. Each folder contains the plots of the values of
the parameters that characterize the distribution naming the folder.
The plot is done through the code in [best_fits_param_calculator.py](best_fits_param_calculator.py)

* [fit_by_sc](fit_by_sc): files containing the values of sum of square 
errors, Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion for each of the 
listed distributions, which are the five best-fitting distributions
for the selected sub-carrier. The distributions are selected among 
a list of the ten most common. The code generating this folder 
is in [fitting_by_sc.py](fitting_by_sc.py)

* [fit_by_sc_2](fit_by_sc_2): files containing the values of sum of square 
errors, Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion for each of the 
listed distributions, which are the five best-fitting distributions
for the selected sub-carrier. The distributions are selected based
on a list specified by the user in [main.py](main.py). The code 
generating this folder is in [fitting_by_sc.py](fitting_by_sc.py)

* [fit_increments](fit_increments) and sub-folders: files containing the values of sum of square 
errors, Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion for each of the 
listed distributions, which are the five best-fitting distributions
for the increments of the selected sub-carrier. 
The distributions are selected based
on a list specified by the user in [main.py](main.py). The code 
generating this folder is in [fitting_by_sc.py](fitting_by_sc.py)

* [histograms](histograms): histograms of the sub-carriers plotted 
by [histograms_plotter.py](histograms_plotter.py)

* [increments_hist](increments_hist): histograms of the increments
of each sub-carrier plotted by [increments_plotter.py](increments_plotter.py)

* [merged_plot](merged_plot): plots and information about merged data
and merged increments generated by [merged_plotter.py](merged_plotter.py)

* [params](params): standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness for 
data and increments generated by [parameters_calculator.py](parameters_calculator.py)

* [time_evolution](time_evolution): plots of the evolution of the 
amplitude of the packets through time for each sub-carrier generated
by [time_evolution_plotter.py](time_evolution_plotter.py)

The [csi.csv](csi.csv) file contains the data to be plotted: as 
indicated by the filename extension, it contains 
comma-separated values (strings), each of them representing 
a complex number (that is formatted as needed within the code
in order to have the numbers parsed correctly 
by Python).
Essentially, the `csi.csv` file contains an _n * 256_ table, 
where 256 is the number of studied sub-carriers, and _n_ 
is the number of packets sampled on each sub-carrier. 
It is important to know the number of sampled packets 
(column length) because 
the `histograms_plotter.py` file contains a function that 
needs a divisor 
of the column length as a default parameter to split every 
column in equally-long batches. 
This divisor must be manually modified in the script and 
can be found among the parameters of the
`plot_histogram_for_sc` function in `histograms_plotter.py`.

The [unnecessaryPlots](unnecessaryPlots) file contains the names of the 
sub-carriers that do not need to be plotted because they 
are unused for modulation, therefore are not currently 
relevant to the purpose of this study.
If necessary, it is possible to add other sub-carriers to
the list contained in this file. In order to do so, one 
can simply add to the file a new line containing the 
string "SC" followed
by the number of the sub-carrier that does not need to be
plotted. 

It is fundamental that the names of all files and folders
(except for those having a `.py` extension) stay unaltered 
because they are embedded as strings in the code, 
therefore their change would cause the script not to compile
and run correctly. 

## Python files content
Below are listed the Python files whose methods are called
in [main.py](main.py): 
* [auto-correlation_plotter.py](autocorrelation_plotter.py):
contains functions that are used to plot graphs representing
the auto-correlation process for each sub-carrier
* [best_fits_param_calculator.py](best_fits_param_calculator.py):
contains functions that are used to fit the five distributions
that best fit the merged increments onto each sub-carrier
and to calculate and plot their parameters
* [fitting_by_sc.py](fitting_by_sc.py): contains functions that 
are used to find the best-fitting distribution for each 
sub-carrier and for the distributions of the increments
of each sub-carrier and save each output in a dedicated file 
* [histograms_plotter.py](histograms_plotter.py): contains functions that are used
to plot a magnitude/relative frequency histogram 
for each sub-carrier, including functions used to verify 
whether a process is stationary, divide the column 
corresponding to a process in batches, and process each batch
* [increments_plotter.py](increments_plotter.py): contains functions that are used
to plot an increment/frequency histogram 
for each sub-carrier 
* [merged_plotter.py](merged_plotter.py): contains the functions
that are used to elaborate the merged increments (i.e. by 
considering all the increments as if they belonged to a single
sub-carrier)
* [parameters_calculator.py](parameters_calculator.py): contains 
the functions that are used to calculate variance, skewness
kurtosis for each sub-carrier and for the distribution of 
the increments of each sub-carrier
* [std_deviation_and_kurtosis_plotter.py](std_deviation_and_kurtosis_plotter.py):
contains a function used to plot standard deviation and kurtosis
calculated on the increments of each sub-carrier
* [time_evolution_plotter.py](time_evolution_plotter.py): contains a function that is used
to plot a graph representing the evolution of the signal
magnitude over time for each sub-carrier
